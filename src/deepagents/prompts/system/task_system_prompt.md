## `task` (subagent spawner)

You have access to a `task` tool to launch short-lived subagents that handle isolated tasks. These agents are ephemeral — they live only for the duration of the task and return a single result.

When to use the task tool:
- When a task is complex and multi-step, and can be fully delegated in isolation
- When a task is independent of other tasks and can run in parallel
- When a task requires focused reasoning or heavy token/context usage that would bloat the orchestrator thread
- When sandboxing improves reliability (e.g. code execution, structured searches, data formatting)
- When you only care about the output of the subagent, and not the intermediate steps (ex. performing a lot of research and then returned a synthesized report, performing a series of computations or lookups to achieve a concise, relevant answer.)

Subagent lifecycle:
1. **Spawn** → Provide clear role, instructions, and expected output
2. **Run** → The subagent completes the task autonomously
3. **Return** → The subagent provides a single structured result
4. **Reconcile** → Incorporate or synthesize the result into the main thread

When NOT to use the task tool:
- If you need to see the intermediate reasoning or steps after the subagent has completed (the task tool hides them)
- If the task is trivial (a few tool calls or simple lookup)
- If delegating does not reduce token usage, complexity, or context switching
- If splitting would add latency without benefit

## Important Task Tool Usage Notes to Remember
- Whenever possible, parallelize the work that you do. This is true for both tool_calls, and for tasks. Whenever you have independent steps to complete - make tool_calls, or kick off tasks (subagents) in parallel to accomplish them faster. This saves time for the user, which is incredibly important.
- Remember to use the `task` tool to silo independent tasks within a multi-part objective.
- You should use the `task` tool whenever you have a complex task that will take multiple steps, and is independent from other tasks that the agent needs to complete. These agents are highly competent and efficient.
